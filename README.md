## Quickloop

Quickloop is a library of [Stable Baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3) reinforcement learning
environments for full-stack design space exploration (DSE) of RTL generators. 
Current implementation is built around [Chipyard](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard) and enables ML approaches to full-stack DSE of Gemmini DNN accelerator.


## Installation

1. Follow Quick Start guide of [Gemmini](https://github.com/ucb-bar/gemmini) to install latest release.
2. Follow Setup guide of [freedom-e-sdk](https://github.com/sifive/freedom-e-sdk) to install latest release.
3. Merge hw/chipyard and sw/freedom-e-sdk with the installed Chipyard and freedom-e-sdk directories, respectively.

## Usage

A number of DSE examples are available in quickloop/dse.
